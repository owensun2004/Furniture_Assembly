There is one page of the setup manual overlayed with mask segmentations, indicating one step.

### Step 1:
- **Parts Needed:** Tabletop (0), Legs (1, 2, 3, 4)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Attach Legs to Tabletop:** 
    - Position the tabletop (0) upside down.
    - Attach each leg (1, 2, 3, 4) to the corresponding corners of the tabletop as shown in the segmented manual.
    - Ensure each leg is securely connected to provide stability to the structure.

This step involves aligning and securing all four legs to the tabletop, completing the basic assembly of the bench.
