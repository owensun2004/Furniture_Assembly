There are six pages of the setup manual, each with a big, bold black number indicating the step. Thus, there are six total steps.

### Step 1:
- **Parts Needed:** Side Panels (0, 1, 2, 3), Legs (4, 5, 6, 7)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Assemble Base:** Connect the side panels (0, 1, 2, 3) to the legs (4, 5, 6, 7) to form the base structure as shown in the red segmentation.

### Step 2:
- **Parts Needed:** Support Bars (8, 9, 10, 11)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Add First Shelf:** Attach the support bars (8, 9, 10, 11) to the top of the base structure to create the first shelf, as indicated in green.

### Step 3:
- **Parts Needed:** Support Bars (12, 13, 14), Back Panel (15)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Build Second Layer:** Connect additional support bars (12, 13, 14) and the back panel (15) to the existing structure to form the second layer, as shown in the red segmentation.

### Step 4:
- **Parts Needed:** Support Bars (8, 9, 10, 11)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Add Second Shelf:** Place another set of support bars (8, 9, 10, 11) on top of the second layer to create the second shelf, as indicated in green.

### Step 5:
- **Parts Needed:** Support Bars (12, 13, 14)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Build Third Layer:** Attach more support bars (12, 13, 14) to the structure to form the third layer, as shown in the red segmentation.

### Step 6:
- **Parts Needed:** Support Bars (8, 9, 10, 11)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Add Top Shelf:** Complete the assembly by placing the final set of support bars (8, 9, 10, 11) on top to form the top shelf, as indicated in green.

This plan follows the manual's instructions, focusing on the colored segmented parts for each step.
