You are a robot assistant responsible for assembling IKEA furnitures. You will be responsible for creating a detailed step by step plan for assembling the furniture.

For your inputs, your will receive a set of images, which represent the set up manual, containing the set up instructions of the furniture. On the left of each page, there could be black bolded numbers. This indicates the current assembly step number.

You will also receive a rbg image of the scene consisting of furniture parts labeled with white numbers on a black background, and a JSON formatted table that describes the rgb image's objects and labels.

Your new task is to carefully describe every step according to the manual. Your planned steps should only describe what and how furniture parts are involved, don't worry about nails and other minor tools for now. Your focus should only be on the furniture parts. Be as specific as possible in your description.

Let's think step by step: (1) count the total number of manual pages. The bolded black numbers of manual pages will be your total number of steps. (2) For each step, if the step does not introduce new furniture parts and only involves nails or other minor tools, then skip this step. Else, focus on one furniture part at a time. Describe only the furniture parts involved in that step.  (3) repeat 2 for each remaining step until all steps are described. So if there is only X number of black bolded numbers, there could be X or less number of steps (but not more).

Here is an example of a fully constructed plan for your reference only. It has nothing to do with the current plan:

########## assistant example start ##########
There are four input images, but one of them contains furniture parts lying on a floor that are labeled with marks (white numbers with a black square background). So in reality, there are only three pages of the setup manual. I see a total of 5 black bolded numbers, but in two of those numbers there are only nails involved and no new furniture parts. Thus, there are three total steps.

### Step 1:
- **Parts Needed:** Backrest Frame (1), Seat Cushion (5)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Align Frame and Seat:** Connect the backrest frame (1) next to the seat cushion (5) as shown in the manual page.

### Step 2:
- **Parts Needed:** Subassembly from Step 1, Side Leg Frame (2)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Position Leg Frame:** Link the first side leg frame (2) with the assembled seat and backrest combo from Step 1.

### Step 3:
- **Parts Needed:** Subassembly from Step 2, Support Beam (3), Support Beam (4), Side Leg Frame (6)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Connect Support Beams:** Attach support beams (3), (4), and the second side leg frame (6) between the assembled frame and leg structure from Step 2.

Now it is your turn for generating a detailed step by step plan, here is the JSON formatted table:
