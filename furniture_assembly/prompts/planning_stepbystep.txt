Now you will be responsible for creating a detailed step by step plan for assembling the furniture using the table of selected materials you outputted above. 

Let's start simple and break the detailed step by step plan into muliple batches: Your task is to create one batch of steps (max 4, min 1) at a time.

For your inputs, your will receive a set of images, which represent a few pages of the set up manual, containing the set up instructions of the furniture. On the left of each page, there is a rectangular section with a white background and a big black bolded number. This indicates the current assembly step number. You can also see that in each page, the furniture is segmented with different colors (the three most common colors are red, green, and purple, but sometimes there are other colors as well). This is to better aid your understanding of which furniture parts are involved in each step of the furniture assembly.

You will also receive a rbg image of the scene consisting of furniture parts labeled with white numbers on a black background, and a JSON formatted table that describes the rgb image's objects and labels.

Your new task is to carefully describe every step according to the manual. Each colored segmented furniture part should correspond to one step. Once again, your planned steps should only describe what and how segmented furniture parts are involved, don't worry about nails and other minor tools for now. Your focus should only be on the colored segmented furniture parts. Be as specific as possible in your description.

Let's think step by step: (1) count the total number of colored, segmented furniture parts. (Hint: This equals the total number of pages in the manual, with each page identified by a big, bold black number in the top left corner.) The total number of colored, segmented furniture parts will be your total number of steps. (2) for each step, focus on one colored, segmented furniture part at a time. Describe only the furniture parts involved in that step. (3) repeat 2 for each remaining step until all steps are described. So if there is only one page of the setup manual overlayed with mask segmentations, then there is only one step. If there is ten pages of the setup manual overlayed with mask segmentations, then there are ten steps.

Here is an example of a fully constructed plan for your reference only. It has nothing to do with the current plan:

There are five input images, but one of them contains furniture parts lying on a floor that are labeled with marks (white numbers with a black square background). So in reality, there are only four pages of the setup manual overlayed with mask segmentations. Thus, there are four total steps.

### Step 1:
- **Parts Needed:** Backrest Frame (1), Seat Cushion (5)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Align Frame and Seat:** Connect the backrest frame (1) next to the seat cushion (5) as shown in the segmented manual.

### Step 2:
- **Parts Needed:** Subassembly from Step 1, Side Leg Frame (2)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Position Leg Frame:** Link the first side leg frame (2) with the assembled seat and backrest combo from Step 1.

### Step 3:
- **Parts Needed:** Subassembly from Step 2, Support Beam (3), Support Beam (4), Side Leg Frame (6)
- **Instructions:**
  - **Connect Support Beams:** Attach support beams (3), (4), and the second side leg frame (6) between the assembled frame and leg structure from Step 2.

Now it is your turn! Let's start with the first batch of steps
